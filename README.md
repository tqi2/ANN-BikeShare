# BikeShare-Prediction-with-NeuralNet
Developed as coursework for Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree. In this project, I built a simple neural network,1 hidden layer with 4 units, sigmoid as activation function, to predict daily bike rental ridership at Washington D.C..

## Dataset & Background
Bike-sharing rental process is highly correlated to the environmental and seasonal settings. For instance, weather conditions, precipitation, day of week, season, hour of the day, etc. can affect the rental behaviors. The core data set is related to the two-year historical log corresponding to years 2011 and 2012 from Capital Bikeshare system, Washington D.C., USA which is publicly available in http://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data. 

## Goal
The Neural network was built from "scratch", using only NumPy without other frameworks like Keras and Pytorch (see my_answer.py for the raw NN code). The goal of this project is to understand the neural network algorithm, how to implement it by myself and prepare to dive deeper into TensorFlow and PyTorch.

## Result

After 15000 iterations, the validation loss ends very low with 0.143, the prediction on test data returns pretty good result, see graph for more detail.
